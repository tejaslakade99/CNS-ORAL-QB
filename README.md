## Networking Fundamentals:

1. **What are the different types of cables used in networking, and what connectors are used for each type?**
   - Ethernet cables, like Cat 5e or Cat 6, use RJ-45 connectors.
   - Fiber optic cables use connectors such as SC, LC, or ST.

2. **What is the maximum segment size for twisted pair and fiber optic cables?**
   - Twisted pair cables have a maximum segment size of 100 meters.
   - Fiber optic cables vary in maximum segment size but can extend up to several kilometers.

3. **How many wires and twists are there in UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cables?**
   - UTP typically has 8 wires and 4 twists per inch.

4. **Which cable is commonly used in LANs?**
   - Ethernet cables, such as Cat 5e or Cat 6, are commonly used in LANs.

5. **What is the purpose of a firewall?**
   - A firewall provides network security by filtering and controlling incoming and outgoing traffic, protecting against unauthorized access and threats.

6. **Explain different network topologies, their advantages, disadvantages, and your preference for designing a LAN.**
   - Network topologies include star (scalable, easy to troubleshoot), bus (simple but single point of failure), ring (redundancy but potential data collisions), and mesh (high redundancy but complex). My preference is a star topology for its scalability and ease of troubleshooting.

7. **List the IEEE standards for Ethernet LAN.**
   - IEEE standards for Ethernet LAN include 802.3 (Ethernet), 802.3u (Fast Ethernet), 802.3ab (Gigabit Ethernet), and various others for specific applications.

8. **What factors do you consider when designing a network for 10 PCs?**
   - Factors include bandwidth requirements, scalability for future growth, security measures, cost-effectiveness, and the need for centralized services and data storage.
