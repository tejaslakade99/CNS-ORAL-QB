## Networking Fundamentals

**1. What are the different types of cables used in networking, and what connectors are used for each type?**
   - Ethernet cables, like Cat 5e or Cat 6, use RJ-45 connectors.
   - Fiber optic cables use connectors such as SC, LC, or ST.

**2. What is the maximum segment size for twisted pair and fiber optic cables?**
   - Twisted pair cables have a maximum segment size of 100 meters.
   - Fiber optic cables vary in maximum segment size but can extend up to several kilometers.

**3. How many wires and twists are there in UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cables?**
   - UTP typically has 8 wires and 4 twists per inch.

**4. Which cable is commonly used in LANs?**
   - Ethernet cables, such as Cat 5e or Cat 6, are commonly used in LANs.

**5. What is the purpose of a firewall?**
   - A firewall provides network security by filtering and controlling incoming and outgoing traffic, protecting against unauthorized access and threats.

**6. Explain different network topologies, their advantages, disadvantages, and your preference for designing a LAN.**
   - **Star Topology:**
     - Advantages: Scalable, easy to troubleshoot.
     - Disadvantages: Dependent on a central hub or switch.
     - Preference: Preferred for its scalability and ease of troubleshooting.

   - **Bus Topology:**
     - Advantages: Simple, cost-effective.
     - Disadvantages: Single point of failure.

   - **Ring Topology:**
     - Advantages: Redundancy.
     - Disadvantages: Potential data collisions.

   - **Mesh Topology:**
     - Advantages: High redundancy.
     - Disadvantages: Complex to set up and manage.

**7. List the IEEE standards for Ethernet LAN.**
   - IEEE standards for Ethernet LAN include 802.3 (Ethernet), 802.3u (Fast Ethernet), 802.3ab (Gigabit Ethernet), and various others for specific applications.

**8. What factors do you consider when designing a network for 10 PCs?**
   - Factors to consider include bandwidth requirements, scalability for future growth, security measures, cost-effectiveness, and the need for centralized services and data storage.
